They travel great distances during their seasonal migration, the farthest migration of any mammal, with distances up to 11,706 miles recorded. Despite this impressive feat, minimal information is known about their migratory journeys. We have tagged numerous humpback whales with ARGOS satellite tags in the Antarctic feeding grounds over the past several years and have collected data on complete tracks from Antarctica to the western coast of South America. This is the first study to examine humpback whale migratory routes from foraging to breeding grounds, and one of the few to have a workable sample size. We will use this information to create a comprehensive overview of migratory behaviors and characteristics.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBiography:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMichelle Modest originally hails from State College, Pennsylvania.

She is now a first year PhD student in Ari Friedlaender’s lab at UC Santa Cruz, and is very excited to spend the next 5 years investigating the effects of climate change on humpback whales in the Western Antarctic Peninsula.\u003c/p\u003e ","link":"https://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-Forty-Plus/events/250375428/","created":{"$numberLong":"1525271041000"},"status":"upcoming","start_time":{"$numberLong":"1559095200000"},"end_time":{"$numberLong":"1559102400000"},"duration":7200000,"venue":{"id":1471598,"name":"Bay Model Visitor Center","location":[-122.49557495117188,37.864112854003906],"address_1":"2100 Bridgeway","city":"Sausalito","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"94965","state":"CA"},"price":0,"is_free":true,"category":{"id":30,"name":"Singles"}}

Before returning home to Los Angeles, he was a professor at Harvard Business School for 13 years. His book, The Founder’s Dilemmas: Anticipating and Avoiding the Pitfalls That Can Sink a Startup, was an Amazon #1 bestseller in Management, has spent more than half a decade on the Strategy bestseller list.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor more than a decade, his research has focused on founders’ early decisions that can make or break the startup and its team. At HBS, he developed and teaches an MBA elective, “Founders’ Dilemmas,” for which he was awarded the HBS Faculty Teaching Award and the Academy of Management’s 2010 Innovation in Pedagogy Award. In 2011, the course was also named one of the top entrepreneurship courses in the country by Inc. magazine. His book, The Founder’s Dilemmas: Anticipating and Avoiding the Pitfalls That Can Sink a Startup, was published in March by Princeton University Press. Both The Founder’s Dilemmas (the book) and Founders’ Dilemmas (the course) provide a roadmap for founders about the most common pitfalls they will face. The book and course integrate Noam’s research results, quantitative data collected over the last decade from 10,000 founders, case studies, and conceptual frameworks. Noam’s second book is Life is a Startup: What Founders Can Teach Us about Making Choices and Managing Change (Stanford University Press, fall 2018).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAbout the Book--Founder’s Dilemmas. ( A must-read for every startup entrepreneur.) --------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr/\u003eOften downplayed in the excitement of starting up a new business venture is one of the most important decisions entrepreneurs will face: should they go it alone, or bring in co-founders, hires, and investors to help build the business? More than just financial rewards are at stake. Friendships and relationships can suffer. Bad decisions at the inception of a promising venture lay the foundations for its eventual ruin.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5c19509b245bce336c3dc300"},"name":"Motion: The Sexual Revolution was a Mistake","description":"\u003cp\u003eIf you would like to moderate this debate, contact Event Host Deborah through Meet-up.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDuring the 1960s, the urge to 'find oneself' and a quest for autonomy were characterized by changes towards sexual attitudes. These changes to sexual attitudes and behavior during the period are often referred to generally as the 'sexual revolution'. As described at the time, the sexual revolution represented a “new permissiveness in sexual behavior…a “new morality” freed of hypocrisy and fear and grounded in tolerance…a state of mind, in which sex would be separated—as far as science, will and conscience could separate it—from duty, pain and fear, from everything but pleasure, and there would be an equality of giving pleasure and taking it, as in a mythic democracy where power would not be exercised by one group or person over another…in essence a women's revolution, [challenging] old assumptions about the nature of female sexuality and women's place in society.” (Worsnop, 1970)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWell, that was how it looked then. These days, a sexual counter-revolution has taken hold, amidst growing concern that generations of free and easy sex has taken a toll on the lives of both men and women, not to mention families and children, leading more and more young adults to steer clear of sex altogether. Critics of the sexual revolution argue that it led to generations of men unmotivated to grow up or commit to serious relationships, in large part because men saw less need to make themselves into appealing long-term partners. According to this argument, the multi-decade epidemic of sexual harassment and assault, single moms and deadbeat dads is a direct consequence of the 1960s sexual revolution. Some call for a return to a norm of sexual restraint. As Christine Emba put it, “Now could be the time to reintroduce virtues such as prudence, temperance, respect and even love. We might pursue the theory that sex possibly has a deeper significance than just recreation and that ‘consent’—that thin and gameable boundary—might not be the only moral sensibility we need respect.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo what do you think? Did the sexual revolution do more harm than good? Was the sexual revolution necessary for the evolution of feminism and LGBT rights? Is the sexual revolution being blamed for ills that have other causes? Join us at the next SFDebate to explore and debate these and other questions.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFurther reading:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSexual revolution: myth or reality Worsnop, R. L.

Georg escapes to Marseille at the last moment. His luggage contains the legacy of a writer named Weidel, who took his own life out of fear of persecution. This legacy comprises a manuscript, some letters and the Mexican Embassy’s assurance of a visa. Assuming the identity of Weidel, Georg tries to obtain one of the few scarce passages on a ship. Talks between refugees take place in the corridors of his small hotel, the waiting rooms of consulates, and the cafés and bars down at the harbour. Georg befriends Driss, the son of his late comrade Heinz, who died whilst trying to flee. But when he meets the mysterious Marie, his plans change.

Four ordinary German youths trying to navigate the scarcities and prohibitions of Berlin at the height of World War II. They hailed from different social classes and different neighborhoods, but they shared a single common secret: they were Jews. While Goebbels infamously declared Berlin “free of Jews” in 1943, some 1,700 managed to survive in Nazism’s capital until liberation. Claus Räfle’s gripping docudrama traces the stories of four real-life survivors who learned that sometimes the best place to hide is in plain sight. While moving between cinemas, cafés and safe houses they dodged Gestapo and a dense network of spies and informants, knowing that certain death was just one mistake away. Yet their prudence was at odds with their youthful inclination towards recklessness, sometimes prompting them to join the resistance, forge passports, or pose as Aryan war widows. Masterfully weaving the different story threads together, The Invisibles is a testament to the resourcefulness, willpower, and sheer chance that permit us to survive against incredible odds.

You want your work to have meaning. Maybe you're even audacious enough to want saving the world to be fun. What if saving the earth were a game? Not just any game, but the greatest game we’ve ever played. This workbook helps social and environmental change professionals learn how to implement powerful techniques from the fields of game design, behavioral psychology, design, data science, and storytelling, that are not only proven to have impact, but can make your project fun.\u003cbr/\u003eIn a 10-step framework of exercises, tutorials, and case studies, How to Save the World will teach you the art of changing the world - and it’s often not what you think. Did you know that just by putting a sign above a recycling bin that showed people the number of cans inside, increased the recycling rate by 67 percent? Or when people standing in line at a cafe were told that other customers before them had ordered a vegetarian meal, that this simple intervention doubled the total rate of vegetarian meal orders? By implementing these academically researched, and measurement-driven techniques, How to Save the World will drive you to dig into your creativity and unearth your greatest ideas that shift the numbers on the causes you most care about, so you can experience the joy and satisfaction of seeing your work, really, actually change the world every single day.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMore details here: \u003ca href=\"http://katiepatrick.com/buy-manual\" class=\"linkified\"\u003ehttp://katiepatrick.com/buy-manual\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBooks will be available for purchase on the Indiegogo campaign page that will be activated Monday 15th October, 12pm:\u003cbr/\u003eDigital \u0026amp; audio book $25.00\u003cbr/\u003eSoftcover print $37.00 + shipping\u003cbr/\u003eHardcover print $47.00 + shipping\u003cbr/\u003eMultiple orders of 3,5, or 10 available if you'd like to give to friends and colleagues.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe digital books will be ready by mid November, and the print editions will be mailed by Christmas time 2018.\u003c/p\u003e ","link":"https://www.meetup.com/change-the-world-with-data-behavior-and-game-design/events/255306766/","created":{"$numberLong":"1538777494000"},"status":"upcoming","start_time":{"$numberLong":"1539709200000"},"end_time":{"$numberLong":"1539712800000"},"duration":3600000,"price":0,"is_free":true,"category":{"id":4,"name":"Community \u0026 Environment"},"meta_category":{"id":552,"name":"Movements"}}

Early in her career, she sought to break the gender barrier in male-dominated science fiction and did so thrillingly, quickly racking up awards and writing a long string of unforgettable novels like The Earthsea Trilogy, The Left Hand of Darkness, The Dispossessed, and The Lathe of Heaven. Through her writing, Le Guin offered readers a glimpse into new forms of life, questioning the dominant narratives of her time (and ours) and offering a staunchly anti-capitalist, utopian view of human, plant, and animal life. First-time director Arwen Curry’s loving, grounded portrait of Le Guin probes deep into her life and work, offering a primer for the uninitiated and new avenues of interpretation and moments of nostalgic joy for her innumerable longtime fans.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHere is a link to the trailer \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqH3nqXqlgs\" class=\"embedded\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqH3nqXqlgs\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e ","link":"https://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-Film-Society/events/255054194/","created":{"$numberLong":"1538050417000"},"status":"upcoming","start_time":{"$numberLong":"1540521000000"},"end_time":{"$numberLong":"1540528200000"},"duration":7200000,"venue":{"id":357934,"name":"Balboa Theater","location":[-122.49769592285156,37.77573013305664],"address_1":"3630 Balboa St","city":"San Francisco","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"94111","state":"CA"},"price":0,"is_free":true,"category":{"id":20,"name":"Movies \u0026 Film"},"meta_category":{"id":583,"name":"Film"}}

There’ll also be a list of things to do available at the villa as well.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOur villa, Villa Baiocco, was built in the early 1700s and recently renovated into a luxury holiday home with 7 rooms in the main villa, each with a private, full bathroom. It’s on almost 5 acres of beautifully kept gardens and fields and also has a swimming pool. The villa is on the Tuscan/Umbrian border, halfway between Florence and Rome, so it’s perfectly located to explore lots of different places.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eVilla Baiocco is about 1 km from a town called Città della Pieve (approx. 15 mins. on foot). It’s a charming town with just over 7,000 residents. There are several eateries and cafes to choose from and its grand wall used to protect the town from the 1300s is magnificent. Città della Pieve also won the first Pio Alferano Prize as the most perfect city in Italy and it’s only 1 kilometer from our villa!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMost other villas in Tuscany/Umbria are about 5 - 15 km to the closest town. So a car would be needed for the duration of the trip which is a very expensive additional cost. Other villages within walking distance from other villas only have 100 or so residents and lack basic amenities such as banks as well as restaurants, bars, cafes and shops. Our villa is perfect thanks to its close proximity to the town. We’ll most likely be the only visitors there which makes it a great escape from the droves of tourists in nearby cities. May and August are great times to visit this area as all the cafes and restaurants open their outdoor terraces.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eUpon arrival, there’ll be a welcome dinner to get to know each other. In the villa’s main salon, there will be a community board to post/suggest any ideas, activities or announcements. For example, if you would like to host an aperitivo before dinner one night, you can add this announcement to the whiteboard. Or maybe you want to enjoy a pizza and pool day. Our villa has a traditional wood-fired pizza oven on the patio, so if you want to invite the others, you can just post a note on the board. When more people join, the cost of that activity is less! It is your choice in what activities you want to participate, but you are free to plan events, host dinners or organize trips/excursions for the group or just for yourself.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat is included :\u003cbr/\u003e14 / 27 nights accommodation (Double occupancy)\u003cbr/\u003eLocal Italian guide/concierge\u003cbr/\u003eInternational airport pick-up\u003cbr/\u003eBreakfast served daily\u003cbr/\u003eWelcome dinner\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf you are interested or have questions, please email : [masked]\u003c/p\u003e ","link":"https://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-International-Travelers/events/251875696/","created":{"$numberLong":"1529306085000"},"status":"upcoming","start_time":{"$numberLong":"1557021600000"},"end_time":{"$numberLong":"1557028800000"},"duration":7200000,"price":0,"is_free":true,"category":{"id":31,"name":"Socializing"},"meta_category":{"id":272,"name":"Social"}}

You can cut corners to make it more affordable by staying in land-based hotels and then do day trips out to some of the islands, but you would not get to see the more far flung islands this way. We have opted for a cruise because a land-based tour in the Galapagos puts you with many other tourists which can make each boat transit time as long as 2 hours one way (or more) on dinghy.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe chose a cruise rather than a land-based experience, so that we can go to the more far flung islands that land based tourists will not get to see. We'll sail at night and then wake up at our next destination. The cruise is 5 days/4 nights. Most cruises are either a 4, 5 or 8 days. The 4 day cruise is a bit too short and the 8 day a bit too long. The 5 day cruise allows for just the right amount of time to explore the Galapagos. If you would like to look at the boat we'll be sailing around the islands, please click on the link below.

Many tour groups opt for larger boats and in doing so you will have 50 - 100 other people that will be with you on the beaches and hikes making for a not so serene hike or tons of people in your pictures on \"deserted\" beaches.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAlso, you must load into a dinghy to get from the cruise boat to the islands and with over 50 people, the load time can take over an hour.

Investors who are still looking for a way to take your real estate investing to the next level, here are the three pieces that we use to get clear and take action.  It's a new kind of association or REIA.  We'd like to share these with you because we know that\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e                               \u003cb\u003e WE ARE UNBEATABLE TOGETHER\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e

   A way to get yourself to take consistent action\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf you’re pretty sure it's not going the way you want it to, then you’re in the right place because when it comes to your dream, nothing is more important than figuring out what’s missing and changing it.  \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAlmost every real estate investor, including myself, has big dreams, big goals.  That’s what I love about this business.  Yet, as motivated and self-directed entrepreneurs who are willing to invest and do whatever it takes, an astonishingly small number of us actually break into the ranks of true, professional investing.  I’ve done it myself and my mission is to make that, and much, much more,  happen for you as well.  \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI can’t believe how much great information and strategies on real estate investing are now readily available everywhere, in live events, books, audios and online.  It’s crazy how good the information is and how accessible, in fact, we are drowning in information and content, So, obviously, If it was about great information and content, you probably wouldn’t even be here.  You’d be out doing deals or on the beach somewhere.  We’re both here for one reason.  As investors who want more, the one thing we all have in common is that we’re not at the level we want to be at yet.  We believe that closing the gap for you and me and our fellow members requires a trusted network and community.  \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThat’s why we’re here.  To bridge the gap between having great information and strategies and turning that into the action, profits and life we all want.  \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis is our Launch event showcasing a new format and way of  getting you great information and strategies on real estate investing, PLUS access to the information, strategies and how-tos on using and becoming an expert at Private lending.  \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe missing piece is what a Tony Robbins or perhaps some other great coach you once had in your life would call emotional mastery or grit  That’s the piece that gets you to go beyond getting the information, beyond taking a little action.  The piece that gets you to consistently use it, master it and profit from it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis is not a pitchfest.  There will be no hidden agendas or surprise pitches.  Instead, this month’s meeting is all about breaking through what’s stopping you from mastering your Real Estate Investing.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCome learn and experience the Four keys of mastery in any arena and to becoming a successful real estate investor and more starts here.  We have the keys to Peak Performance of Master Investors and we want to share them with you:\u003c/p\u003e

In short, she is everything society expects from a concierge at a bourgeois building in a posh Parisian neighborhood.

While we are individuals with different wants and needs, research suggests that volunteering is an activity that everyone can benefit from to live a more meaningful life. Back in 2016, Daryl Van Tongeren and his colleagues sought to examine this relationship in an article for The Journal of Positive Psychology. In a preliminary study, the researchers asked over 400 participants to report on how frequently they engage in different altruistic behaviors (such as volunteering) and how meaningful their life feels. Participants who were more altruistic reported a greater sense of purpose and meaning in their lives.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe importance of service to the wellbeing of our soul makes sense, especially in the United States. Americans embody a strong culture of individualism and achievement that we often get lost in our own worlds, losing perspective about the bigger picture of life.

Following in de Lucía’s footsteps, he’s forged musical ties with artists around the world, from Sting to Brazilian masters Milton Nascimento and Eliane Elias to jazz guitar innovators including John McLaughlin and Al Di Meola. Born outside of Seville and raised in Córdoba, Amigo began working professionally as a teen, and in 1993, the same year he released his debut album, he was awarded Best Flamenco Guitarist by Guitar Player magazine.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBy the time Amigo made his Bay Area debut in 2002, the guitarist’s career was in rapid ascent on the heels of his fourth album, City of Ideas, which had won the 2001 Latin GRAMMY as Best Flamenco Album. Following the imaginative blend of Spanish and Celtic influences on 2013’s Tierra, Amigo returns to a pure expression of the flamenco tradition with his new Sony Legacy release Memoria de los Sentidos (Memory of the Senses). The guitarist’s live performances feature pyrotechnic virtuosity, charisma and copious quantities of that intangible quality of Iberian music called duende, which Amigo explains simply: “If you hurt when you hear it, then it’s duende.”\u003c/p\u003e ","link":"https://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-Classical-Guitar-Society/events/253459220/","created":{"$numberLong":"1533320506000"},"status":"upcoming","start_time":{"$numberLong":"1539550800000"},"end_time":0,"duration":0,"venue":{"id":21538952,"name":"SFJAZZ Center, Miner Auditorium","location":[-122.42122650146484,37.77628707885742],"address_1":"201 Franklin Street","city":"San Francisco","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"","state":"CA"},"price":0,"is_free":true,"category":{"id":21,"name":"Music"},"meta_category":{"id":512,"name":"Music"}}

The villancico, one of music’s most resilient and popular vocal genres, originally developed in the 15th century and evolved through the 17th \u0026amp; 18th centuries to become the dominant vocal genre throughout Spain and Latin America. This same period saw the Spanish colonies of Central and South America blossom into well-springs of cultural sophistication. Latin American cathedrals and courtly life demanded a varied and active musical scene. Often, the indigenous populations were drawn into the arts and participated in their production. The musical result was a style that even in sacred compositions bears the imprint of folk music, a delightful intersection of elegance and simplicity. The use of guitars and percussion, coupled with dance rhythms and the occasional use of native languages, demonstrate a close relationship between European and Indigenous cultures.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEL MUNDO: Richard Savino, Director; Jennifer Ellis Kampani, soprano; Adam LaMotte and Lisa Grodin, violins; Aaron Westman, viola; William Skeen, cello; Richard Savino, guitars\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFRIDAY, OCTOBER 12, 8:00PM\u003cbr/\u003eFirst Presbyterian Church\u003cbr/\u003e1140 Cowper Street at Lincoln, Palo Alto\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSATURDAY, OCTOBER 13, 7:30PM\u003cbr/\u003eSt. Mark’s Episcopal Church\u003cbr/\u003e2300 Bancroft Way, Berkeley\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSUNDAY, OCTOBER 14, 4:00PM\u003cbr/\u003eSt. Mark’s Lutheran Church\u003cbr/\u003e1111 O’Farrell at Gough, San Francisco\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBuy Tickets: $45 (Individual tickets go on sale August 13th)\u003cbr/\u003e$12 *students under age 30 with ID\u003cbr/\u003e*Available only at the box office.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSUBSCRIBE ONLINE TODAY*\u003cbr/\u003eFull Series—Six Concerts (Members save 25%, Non-Members save 15%)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDownload and Print Mailable Subscription Form\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e*Individual Tickets For Series Concerts, Special Events \u0026amp; Mini Series Subscriptions Will Become Available on August 13th—SFEMS members save up to 20%\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCall the box office at[masked] or email us \u0026lt;[masked]\u0026gt;.\u003c/p\u003e ","link":"https://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-Classical-Guitar-Society/events/253459365/","created":{"$numberLong":"1533320817000"},"status":"upcoming","start_time":{"$numberLong":"1539558000000"},"end_time":0,"duration":0,"venue":{"id":10570412,"name":"St. Mark's Lutheran Church","location":[-122.4233169555664,37.78449249267578],"address_1":"1111 O'Farrell Street","city":"San Francisco","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"94109","state":"CA"},"price":0,"is_free":true,"category":{"id":21,"name":"Music"},"meta_category":{"id":512,"name":"Music"}}

It is a land trod by noble heroes and unredeemable villains, a great and terrible company to which you and your fellows now belong.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAcross Faerûn, the name “Waterdeep” evokes feelings of wonder, awe, and envy. Although it is not the largest city in the Realms, the City of Splendors is undoubtedly the most famous and most cosmopolitan metropolis on the continent of Faerûn. Having grown rich on a steady diet of trade and industry, this crossroads city combines the best aspects of many cultures into a marvelous shining jewel. Waterdeep’s cultural patrimony is all of Faerûn, and its inhabitants are much richer for it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWaterdeep is home to haughty nobles, diligent craftsmen, scheming merchants, daring sailors, and bold adventurers of every stripe.

Skullport, the Port of Shadow, beckons to those who seek illicit goods and dark dearlings. Ancient feuds divide Waterdeep’s guilds and noble houses, and many factions seek to topple the secretive Lords of Waterdeep. The Arcane Brotherhood of neighboring Luskan seeks to weaken its hated rival to the south, while the Red Wizards of Thay hope to dominate Waterdeep’s markets. The churches of Selûne and Shar use the City of Splendors as a battlefield in their eternal war, while countless mercenary groups come to the city to spend their hard-won earnings. The Shadow Thieves of Amn plot to overthrow the Lords who once drove them out of the city. Spies and mercenaries such as the Knights of the Shield and the Kraken Society spread rumors and steal closely held secrets, while agents of Skullport’s Iron Ring prowl for slaves to abduct into the depths. All the while, the secretive Lords of Waterdeep strive to preserve the city’s tolerant spirit, wise rule, and powerful magical tradition.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLittle do you know that the events that have yet to unfold will bring an unlikely, disparate group of individuals together for the first time.

In short, they are the signatures of bacterial immune systems that scientists have hijacked into biological tools for editing genomes. The DNA-based instruction manuals from which all living things are built and maintained.\u003cbr/\u003eSince 2012, Largely due to its simplicity, efficiency, and low cost; CRISPR has become the genome-editing platform of choice for life scientists around the world. Often described as “molecular scissors,” the CRISPR system typically has two fundamental components: a strand of guide RNA (gRNA) and a CRISPR-associated endonuclease (e.g., Cas9). Together, they form a search-and-snip complex in which the gRNA takes on a hairpin shape.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e• What to bring: Your Laptop\u003cbr/\u003e• Important to know: Please be sure to save your seat on Eventbrite\u003cbr/\u003eLink: \u003ca href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/crispr-workshop-the-new-frontier-of-biotechnology-innovation-tickets-50982888191\" class=\"linkified\"\u003ehttps://www.eventbrite.com/e/crispr-workshop-the-new-frontier-of-biotechnology-innovation-tickets-50982888191\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAgenda\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e5:[masked]pm: Registration \u0026amp; Networking\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e[masked]pm: Introduction\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e6.10- 7.40pm: Lecture\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e7.40- 8.10 pm: Q\u0026amp;A time\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e8.10- 8.30 pm: More Networking\u003c/p\u003e ","link":"https://www.meetup.com/thestartupclubsf/events/255245265/","created":{"$numberLong":"1538601752000"},"status":"upcoming","start_time":{"$numberLong":"1540513800000"},"end_time":{"$numberLong":"1540524600000"},"duration":10800000,"venue":{"id":25420534,"name":"WeWork Embarcadero Center","location":[-122.39840698242188,37.7947883605957],"address_1":"2 Embarcadero Center, 8th Floor","city":"San Francisco","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"","state":"CA"},"price":0,"is_free":true,"category":{"id":34,"name":"Tech"},"meta_category":{"id":292,"name":"Tech"}}

When he regains consciousness he has lost his memory and cannot even remember what language he speaks. From a few things found on the man the doctor, who is originally from Finland, believes him to be a sailor and a fellow countryman, who somehow or other has ended up in Trieste.

We've done big trips before, but this will be by far the biggest. We'll be climbing Mt Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest peak as well as exploring Tsavo National Park in Kenya, and getting to sample East Africa's wonderful people, culture, food, and language. Please don't sign up unless you are serious about committing at least 2 weeks and have the funds for a trip like this. As we get closer I will require a non-refundable $1,000 per person fee for this event, which is not inclusive of any other incurred expenses. This event is open to 15 attendees. Members may bring 1 guest. Sign up now to reserve your spot, and don't worry if you are on the waiting list - I'll do my best to accommodate everyone.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHere's the story - I have 2 Kenyan sons and will likely be living more than 1/2 time in Kenya by the time this trip occurs as I have started a social enterprise organization in Kenya. My sons and likely several Kenyan friends will be with us during this trip. As such, this affords our members an experience money can't buy - a real honest, local experience. That being said, it's not cheap. Expect to spent $5,000 at least all told on this trip (airfare, climbing/porter fees, guides, travel, lodging, etc.). Day to day costs are low, as food/transportation, etc is much cheaper there (other than climbing permits and airfare). I don't and have never traveled like a tourist, and you won't be either. You'll be eating where the locals eat, staying at hotels where Africans stay, etc. If you are looking for a high end, luxury experience look elsewhere. The best part of this trip will be its legitimacy, an opportunity to learn about another culture in a shared experience with locals.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/1/b/2/600_464809586.jpeg\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAt the start of this trip, we'll meet in Kenya and spend a few days getting to know East African culture. I will teach everyone enough basic Swahili during the first few days that it will make it easier to get around, and you'll get a much friendlier reception than the average tourist does. We'll start by spending time in Nairobi enjoying the big city experience Kenyan style, including Nairobi's bumping nightlife, learning about the Maasai people, and visiting a local LGBT refugee organization, Team No Sleep Foundation to learn about the realities of LGBT life in Africa and purchase beautiful handmade bags, curtains, clothes, etc. that are made in support of Team No Sleep.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAfter Nairobi we'll head to Moshi, Tanzania, to climb Kilimanjaro. This will take 7days/6 nights days to climb as we must go up slowly to acclimate to the elevation. DO train for this event, or you won't make it - the mountain has about a 70% success rate. Though we have porters who carry tents and most gear and there is gear needed, this is a big mountain with real consequences.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/2/7/2/600_464809778.jpeg\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAfter Kilimanjaro we'll head back to Kenya for a 3 day safari trip to see The Great Migration in Masai Mara Game Reserve - often regarded as the best wildlife reserve in the entire world.

I thought this might have been a one-off fascinating close-up encounter, but later the cub returned and this time brought its siblings along. Together they explored, played and turned my garden into their playground. I soon became hooked on watching and filming them daily and have been completely enchanted, or as some might say ‘foxed’, by these beautiful, clever and gentle creatures. This is the story of Freya, Faith and Me; a cross-species friendship\"\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThen there is \"The Walrus Whisperer.\" Former animal trainer Phil Demers tells the story of his unique bond with a walrus named Smooshi and his ongoing fight against Marineland.

After World War II, Martin McVeigh's son Al returned from the Navy and took over the family business.

Neha Narkhede, the co-creator of Kafka and cofounder of Confluent, is keynoting the day 2.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe three tracks are\u003cbr/\u003e— Functional and Thoughtful Programming\u003cbr/\u003e— Reactive Microservices and Streaming Architectures\u003cbr/\u003e— End-to-end Data Pipelines all the way up to Machine Learning and AI\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe 100 sessions include technology leaders such as Twitter, IBM, Microsoft, Salesforce, Fauna, DataStax, Databricks, Confluent, Credit Karma, Sumo Logic, GoPro, Buoyant, Workday, Zignal Labs, and many more. We cover your tools with JetBrains, your shopping with Best Buy and Target, your vacations with HomeAway, your listening with Spotify, your viewing with Netflix, your reading with Medium, and your banking with JP Morgan Chase. The list goes on and on and on — we have the most of the advanced stacks and approaches employed by the best that Silicon Valley offers to the world at scale, shared as best practices, with code, yours to learn, take home, and build upon.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOur speakers span the whole spectrum from the first-time presenters with leading companies to veterans of SBTB going all the way back to 2013, evolving their craft before our eyes.

On the first two days, the closing panels are followed by our signature happy hours, with great drinks, food, and conversation. The hallway tracks are legendary.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSBTB is famous for its bespoke, all-day, build-yourself-a-company training. This year, we double it. Cliff Click, the legend of software engineering, is teaching a full day Advanced Software Engineering workshop on 11/13, followed by Ryan Knight, now of Fauna, leading cloud-native data pipelines on 11/14. The workshops are limited by 80 participants each.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs last year, we’ll plan an unconference track for those who want to share their ideas in an intimate setting for joint brainstorming.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe only thing moderate about SBTB is its size — we cap at 600 attendees to preserve the immediate and direct nature of the communication that happens, sparks that fly, and serendipity that always occurs.

Despite Muybridge’s crime, the artist’s patron, railroad tycoon Leland Stanford, founder of Stanford University, hired the photographer to answer the question of whether the four hooves of a running horse ever left the ground all at once—and together these two unlikely men launched the age of visual media.

The anti-heroic genius of Ferdinand's search for a livable life in 20th century Paris forms a direct literary metaphor for modern humanity: to search and search again for happiness and meaning in a complex world and to often come up empty.

In what The Miami Herald calls his \"deathbed ode to eroticism,\" Arenas breaks through the code of secrecy and silence that protects the privileged in a state where homosexuality is a political crime.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5c1950af245bce336c3de7a6"},"name":"Board of Supervisors meeting –        Come get on TV for a good cause!","description":"\u003cp\u003eThe San Francisco Board of Supervisors meets every Tuesday at 2:00 p.m. at City Hall (corner of Polk and Grove) in Room 250, the main chamber on the second floor (from the Polk street entrance, just walk straight back across the rotunda and up the big stairway, and it's the room directly behind the top of the stairs on the 2nd floor).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e========================================================\u003cbr/\u003eAmong the items on the agenda for this week's meeting – \u003ca href=\"http://sfbos.org/sites/default/files/bag041018_agenda.pdf\" class=\"linkified\"\u003ehttp://sfbos.org/sites/default/files/bag041018_agenda.pdf\u003c/a\u003e :\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e• (Item 8) Non-Standard Vehicle Permits (Municipal Transportation Agency) - If future generations someday wonder how San Francisco lost its unique quirkiness and began to morph into just another soulless metropolis, they may look at regulations like this one, an \"Ordinance amending the Transportation Code to prohibit Non-Standard Vehicles from operating without a permit\". Don't you dare be non-conformist without our permission! (And pay us a fee, of course!)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e• (Item 13) Mayoral \"Question Time\" (Supervisors Peskin, Ronen) – The intriguing description of this item is that it would is that it would \"modify the process for the Mayor to appear at the Board of Supervisors for a question-and-answer session\". Since a couple of the leftist Supes are the sponsors, the mayor whom it would immediately affect is a moderate, and another moderate Supe (Stefani) dissented, it would presumably change the rules to increase mayoral accountability, so probably a positive (if cynically political) change!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e• (Items 14-33) A whole slew of \"Memorandums of Understanding\" with various unions, to implement a \"Union Access to New Employees\" program (Mayor's office). This could be inconsequential and benign, or it could be something that would greatly strengthen the power of government employee unions; hard to say from the descriptions\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e• (Items 34-36) Receiving and approving the annual reports of the \"Community Benefit Districts\" in the Yerba Buena Gardens, Union Square, and Castro areas. CBDs are mechanisms whereby the majority of merchants in an area vote to impose new taxes on themselves as well as on an unwilling minority, for purposes of street cleaning, security, and like services which the city government is failing to provide with the ample tax monies it already steals.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e• (Item 39) Temporary suspension of business registration \u0026amp; fee requirements for taxi and rideshare drivers (Supervisor Peskin). Who knows what the reasoning behind this one is, but any break on registration and extortion requirements sounds like a good thing.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e(Items 41-44) The Visitacion Valley Planning Alliance is seeking to block or delay a new development of five homes to replace an existing church building at 590 Leland Avenue by requiring them to submit to an environmental review under the CEQA law. Because they can!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e========================================================\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf you've never been inside SF City Hall, you should come just for the architecture. It's one of the most beautiful and impressive buildings in the city.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSadly, and more relevantly from a libertarian perspective, it's also a place where a lot of harm is caused, and where our influence on the legislative process is desperately needed! Virtually every Board meeting has lots of opportunities for public comment – I believe the Supervisors are required to take public comment on any item that they debate or intend to vote on, and there's also time for general comments on any other matter under their jurisdiction but not on the agenda.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor each comment, you usually get up to two minutes. In addition to speaking, you can also bring printed material of size 8.5\" x 11\" or smaller to put on the overhead projector during your comments.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAll the Board meetings, including all the public comments, are video-recorded and broadcast on Channel 26, also online at SFgovTV.org. Here's a clip of some public comments from the most recent Board meeting on Sept. 4, 2017, in which you can see yours truly take the Supervisors to task and suggest they respond directly on the record to questions from the public! (I'm the 5th speaker, at around 4:01:40):\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://sanfrancisco.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=10\u0026amp;clip_id=28658\" class=\"linkified\"\u003ehttp://sanfrancisco.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=10\u0026amp;clip_id=28658\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNote the 2nd and 4th speakers use the overhead projector option; the 4th speaker spins a top on a map. :-) There are definitely some characters (check out the 7th speaker). Some people have used public comment time to sing, or do other performance art! You could probably even use your time to read a passage from a pro-freedom book, e.g. George Orwell's \"1984\", as long as you somehow relate it to city policy, e.g. \"This is what the city government's policy of putting cameras on Muni buses reminds me of...\"\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAnyway, this Meetup, which will recur every Tuesday when the Board is in session, is your chance to be a minor TV star for a good cause! (I've actually had somebody come up to me on the street and say they recognized me from public comment at a Board meeting!) The Supervisors may or may not listen to you, but your libertarian views will be on the record, and numerous people both in the chambers, live on TV, and later online, will see you. (Note that you're not obliged to give your name or any other personal info unless you want to, and you don't even have to give any public comment unless you feel like it – being there for moral support of those who do, while educating yourself about local politics, is okay too. You could educate others too, by sitting there in the audience and liveblogging on Twitter or something!)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf you plan to come, text me at (415) 625-FREE so you can connect with any other Libertarians showing up that day. Depending what's on the agenda and how long the meeting goes, or how long we feel like staying – Board meetings can last only an hour or two, or up to 7 hours or more – we may go out for dinner or drinks afterward!\u003c/p\u003e ","link":"https://www.meetup.com/RonPaulSF/events/vldbppyxnbvb/","created":{"$numberLong":"1523356433000"},"status":"upcoming","start_time":{"$numberLong":"1539723600000"},"end_time":{"$numberLong":"1539734400000"},"duration":10800000,"venue":{"id":25514736,"name":"San Francisco City Hall","location":[0.0,0.0],"address_1":"Board of Supervisors chamber, Room 250, City Hall (corner of Polk \u0026 Grove)","city":"San Francisco","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"","state":"CA"},"price":0,"is_free":true,"category":{"id":13,"name":"Movements \u0026 Politics"},"meta_category":{"id":552,"name":"Movements"}}

Thus, making religion a matter of personal choice and convenience.  Therefore, people belonging to any faith or age group can comfortably receive the Deeksha.Deeksha is given by laying hands on the recipient’s head, or sometimes through intent.  In this case, the giver holds the receiver in his or her awareness for a few minutes and allows the Deeksha to flow.  In this way, the Deeksha can be given at a distance of thousands of miles or to a large group of people all at the same time.

I have personally seen many ladies who just were not educated because they were girls and all they were thought to be was marriage material so all their lives they were trained to be the perfect housewife and not the perfect asset to society. These poor ladies went through years of mental abuse, physical abuse, so much hardship and they could not get out only because they were not educated enough to be able to find a job to have the courage to leave on their own. My mission since the time I witnessed such situations is to help as many as I can and that starts with children. Little girls who are educated grow to be strong confident ladies who can support themselves. They do not have to tolerate abuse they do not have to tolerate attacks and they have what it takes to make this world such an amazing place. Educating a boy brings 1 more person educated but educating a girl educates a whole family.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe hope to see you all there to support this wonderful cause and event \u0026lt;3 Thank you from all of the sweet Nanhi Kali's you will be supporting\u003cbr/\u003e* Fashion-Featuring the highlight of the evening\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e* Once again, bigger venue, bigger dance floor, upscale decor with a full bar\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e* Dance till you drop-Bay Area's Top DJ's in the mix spinning the latest in Bollywood, Int'l \u0026amp; Classic Oldies to have you on your feet all night!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e* Talent- Bay Area's Top Singers for an entertaining dinner show\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e* Entertainment-Dance Shows**: Bollywood and Bellydance Performances by some of the best performers in the Bay ft MoreUPbeat Dance Fusion Group and Radhika Tilak\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo come on ladies, grab your closest girlfriends and make it an unforgettable evening you will cherish for a lifetime.

We were there early enough -- 9am -- that only a few vehicles were in the parking lot. And we were quickly on the snow, shoeing away from the lodge.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhile we enjoyed the magnificent scene, hoards of visitors began showing up slipping and sliding in the parking lot entry to the snowfield, and the parking lot was just about filled.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAccess was easy: The roads were plowed and the main lodge and facilities were open. Read that, restrooms, snacks, warmth, etc. Unless there are blizzard conditions, the roads seem to get lots of attention from the plow operators.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn addition to the sight-seers, we found other snowshoers, x-country skiers and winter backpackers. Everyone had a smile, even me stumbling along!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe were at the Rim and snowshoeing well before the crowds arrived. We were on snow until early afternoon and were back home before dark. The trip one-way is just over 3 hours from Redding via the Five, 97 and OR 62 west. It's another 20 minutes or so to get to the Rim visitor's center.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhile some will go the night before and overnight, I do this as a day trip. We'll head out of Redding while it's still dark, breakfast big time at Black Bear Diner in KFalls about 7:30am and then hit the Park about 9:15. Be dressed for winter and in layers. Have snowshoes or x-country skis, a daypack, water, snacks, sunscreen, sun glasses, layers of clothing and what you’d wear a on winter day outside in the mountains. An option is to overnight near the park. The closest accommodations are in Klamath Falls which is about and 75 minutes from the Park. Medford is an option but it's a good 45 minutes longer.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe’ll meet at 4:45am and leave at 5 am and it’s easier and more efficient to carpool. Park passes or a daily fee of $15 I think gets you into the park. I have a pass and others may as well.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDue to the size of the group, your carpool will become your own smaller contingent. You'll be able to plan your adventure when we get to the park, including your carpool's return time, etc., so keep in touch with each other. For those meeting us along the way, use the timeline above to meet up with us if you wish. My cell is[masked].

Private Sessions in SF","description":"\u003cp\u003eDear Friends, Next Thursday-Sunday, my good friend, James Hyman, founder of the Deep Emotional Release Bodywork and Quantum-Theta Healing will be in the S.F. area offering private sessions of his powerful system of healing. These 1 1/2 hour sessions for most people, are life-changing, in that James helps you to identify and release long-held repressed emotional energy from the chakras and other energy centers in the body, as well as negative patterns from the subconscious mind that are keeping you blocked and stuck. The release of this blocked energy and unwanted patterns helps all of the body's energy fields come into balance, for a person, usually, for the first time in many years. They feel, \"themselves\", again, and better able to connect with their world from an authentic place of personal power and creative self-expression. Also, they're more connected with their intuition, instinct, Higher Self, and emotional and physical well-being.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEvery time we work with James, stuff comes up that we're not expecting, and it goes deep, and it gets cleared. After that, life feels more deeply in balance. We never know what's going to come up in the session, until we're there, but it feels so good to shake off the cobwebs, go to the core of our emotional issues, gain clarity, and feel that radiant energy surging through our body once again. Colors seem brighter, meditation seems deeper. I remember the first time someone scheduled 5 sessions back to back. We couldn't believe it! That person left an entirely different human being. She proceeded to write several best-selling books and become a nationally known psychic and friend to the famous.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eJames has worked with many amazing people, and some of the most famous people in the world.

SF Games meets almost every Sunday of the year. Because it's right by the park, there are times we try to move it to another location when there is a large event like Outside Lands, or Hardly Strictly, because parking just becomes impossible. Otherwise we meet, rain or shine.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHISTORY OF SF GAMES: SF Games was founded July 5, 1995 by David Kaye. SF Games was begun not as a games group but as a social group with games. This important difference we feel has contributed to the longevity of the group and the continued enjoyment by members year in and year out. Welcome to our visitors from other countries! Many of our games are of German origin, and many can be played without extensive knowledge of English. People from all over the world have joined us during their vacations in San Francisco.

Most people can get in 3 games during the evening.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFeel free to RSVP to this meetup but be aware that many of us who attend regularly do not. Even if no one has RSVP'd to the meetup there will be several people in attendance each and every week. Also, feel free to post questions to the Meetup. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFAQ\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e1 - WHO ATTENDS? All kinds of people ages 17 to about 70, male, female, straight, gay, bi have come to SF Games over the years. Everybody who can play games is welcome to attend. The number of people varies from about 15 to 40 out of a universe of about 200.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2 - WHAT KIND OF GAMES? What we play depends on who comes and what they bring. Generally, games can be divided into two groups: strategy games and social games.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSTRATEGY GAMES: Among the most common popular board games we play are Container, Ticket To Ride, Manhattan Project, Dead of Winter, Power Grid, Acquire, Arctic Scavengers, Race for the Galaxy, Carcassonne, Hansa Teutonica, Tigris \u0026amp; Euphrates, Alhambra, Cosmic Encounter, Ra, Chinatown, Alien Frontiers, Glory to Rome, Terra Mystica, Imperial Settlers, Splendor, Agricola, Ora et Labora, Chicago Express and numerous other European-style board games both new and old.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSOCIAL GAMES: These are for people who like lots of conversation and laughs, where having a good time is more important than refining your game-winning strategy. Examples of social games we play are: Codenames, Apples to Apples, Taboo, Can't Stop, Set, Fluxx, Boggle and Hoopla. Feel free to bring other social games.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSPECIAL DECK CARD GAMES: We also play games that use special packs such as Tichu, Hanabi, San Juan, Bohnanza, Coloretto, Modern Art, Condottiere and Bang.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3 - DO YOU PLAY MY FAVORITE GAME? Don't ask us if we play a game -- come by and bring your game and see!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e4 - DOES SF GAMES MEET EVERY WEEK? This is probably the most frequent question. SF Games meets every Friday of the year unless Christmas Eve or Day falls on a game night. Then we don't meet. Otherwise we meet, rain or shine.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHISTORY OF SF GAMES: SF Games was founded July 5, 1995 by David Kaye. SF Games was begun not as a games group but as a social group with games. This important difference we feel has contributed to the longevity of the group and the continued enjoyment by members year in and year out. Welcome to our visitors from other countries! Many of our games are of German origin, and many can be played without extensive knowledge of English. People from all over the world have joined us during their vacations in San Francisco. We have also been featured in stories appearing in the press in Italy and Germany.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.sfgames.org/\"\u003ewww.sfgames.org\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/01/19/LV212070.DTL\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/01/19/LV212070.DTL\" class=\"linkified\"\u003ehttp://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/01/19/LV212070.DTL\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e ","link":"https://www.meetup.com/boardgames-488/events/mlmmqnyxnbzb/","created":{"$numberLong":"1503104542000"},"status":"upcoming","start_time":{"$numberLong":"1540000800000"},"end_time":0,"duration":0,"venue":{"id":7442432,"name":"Taqueria San Jose","location":[-122.41842651367188,37.75165939331055],"address_1":"2830 Mission Street","city":"San Francisco","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"94110","state":"CA"},"price":0,"is_free":true,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Games"},"meta_category":{"id":182,"name":"Sci-Fi \u0026 Games"}}

After a short lecture, a discussion and debate by the group will follow.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDiplomacy is the art of dealing with people in a sensitive and effective way, whether those people are nations, groups, or other individuals. Without diplomacy, you can neither protect your own interests and further your standing in life, nor can you work with others to accomplish more for yourself and others. Yet, many great leaders were terrible diplomats - boorish, crude, and thoroughly ignorant - and still accomplished much. Steve Jobs created a world class company worth billions and was horrible to his employees, while Richard Nixon opened the doors to China and the East, yet had no internal diplomatic skills. In Antifragile, by Nassim Taleb, its argued that the things which can withstand the least \"diplomatic\" treatment are the things that endure. While Freemasons value the ability to work together and be diplomatic and has produced many great leaders, there may be more life and passion in creating \"Chaos out of Order.\" Perhaps we need a lack of diplomacy to shake up and improve the status quo.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMission Statement\u003cbr/\u003eThe Masonic Philosophical Society embraces the concept of learning, not for school, but for life, and believes that all men, who seek it, deserve access to continued education.

After a short lecture, a discussion and debate by the group will follow.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMarcus Aurelius, Roman emperor from 161 to 180, was a practitioner of Stoicism. His writing called “Meditations” is a significant source of our modern understanding of ancient Stoic philosophy and could be considered the source of Masonic morality. The goal of Stoicism is freedom from passion through the pursuit of reason and apathy, in its ancient sense of being objective, unemotional and having clear judgment. In many respects, it bears a remarkable similarity to the ethical teachings of the Buddha and the four noble truths of Buddhism, and it also bears a remarkable similarity to Masonic teachings.

Attract Highest, Best","description":"\u003cp\u003e• What we'll do\u003cbr/\u003eNext Thursday-Sunday, my good friend, shamanic healer, James Hyman, founder of the Deep Emotional Release Bodywork and Quantum-Theta Healing will be in the S.F. area offering private sessions of his powerful system of healing. These 1 1/2 hour sessions for most people, are life-changing, in that James helps you to identify and release long-held repressed emotional energy from the chakras and other energy centers in the body, as well as negative patterns from the subconscious mind that are keeping you blocked and stuck. The release of this blocked energy and unwanted patterns helps all of the body's energy fields come into balance, for a person, usually, for the first time in many years. They feel, \"themselves\", again, and better able to connect with their world from an authentic place of personal power and creative self-expression. Also, they're more connected with their intuition, instinct, Higher Self, and emotional and physical well-being.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEvery time we work with James, stuff comes up that we're not expecting, and it goes deep, and it gets cleared. After that, life feels more deeply in balance. We never know what's going to come up in the session, until we're there, but it feels so good to shake off the cobwebs, go to the core of our emotional issues, gain clarity, and feel that radiant energy surging through our body once again. Colors seem brighter, meditation seems deeper. I remember the first time someone scheduled 5 sessions back to back. We couldn't believe it! That person left an entirely different human being. She proceeded to write several best-selling books and become a nationally known psychic and friend to the famous.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eJames has worked with many amazing people, and some of the most famous people in the world.

The town has many shrines and temples of its own, giving rise to it’s nickname: ‘Little Kyoto’. Just on the outskirts of the town is the fascinating Hida folk village where old farm houses from across the Hida region have been brought together and rebuilt (beam by beam) on a hillside overlooking the town.

In a village-like atmosphere, the museum features buildings such as the former village head’s house, logging huts, storehouses and a number of gassho-zukuri farmhouses.

It is of course well-known for being the site of one of two atomic bombs dropped on Japan at the end of the Second World War. Despite its tragic past, Hiroshima is now a bustling and vibrant city which has risen phoenix-like from the ashes.

The “bustling” town is home to the vast majority of all residents of the islands combined topping out at a staggering 12,000 people. This offers insight into the the amount of conservation and protected land on the island despite having the only major town in the whole volcanic island chain. From white sand beaches teeming with endemic marine iguana, lush highlands where some of the only giant tortoises in the world still roam, turtle coves, thriving reefs, ancient calderas, \u0026amp; of course, Darwin’s Finches all live in harmony with the small human population here (for once!).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e* Highlands \u0026amp; Tortoise Reserve: Journeying across Santa Cruz into the highlands, we’ll be delighted by the variety of life and geology.

Walk into the forest overgrown with lichens \u0026amp; ferns, and listen carefully for the sound of heavy footsteps and shrubs being slowly crushed as the tortoises make their way through the brush! The pond at El Chato is surrounded by forest where short-eared owls, Darwin’s finches, Vermilion Flycatchers, Yellow Warblers, Galapagos Rails, and Paint-billed Crakes can also be seen.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e* Charles Darwin Research Station: An awesome and fascinating visit to give true perspective for the rest of the adventure!

The Park has the following development programs: conservation of natural resources, management of flora and fauna, sustainable use of resources. Others are related to environmental education, marine resources, agricultural development, monitoring and vigilance.

Land iguanas and Galapagos snakes can be encountered on a lucky day as well!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e* The tours to all islands listed above are subject to availability and regulation guidelines. The park service sometimes changes regulations and rotates the islands which tourists are allowed to access with little or no prior notice.

We’ll board our very own private cruising yacht and embark on a journey throughout the eastern Galapagos Islands. Aboard the Coral II, we’ll live in the perfect combination of classic beauty and exquisite style. Built in Holland, the ship surpasses all the standards you would expect from a high-class yacht, providing a slightly larger than average (and therefore more stable) cruising vessel while maintaining the friendly atmosphere of a small expedition yacht.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEvery cabin features handsome wood decoration, along with air-conditioning, a private bathroom, safe deposit box, telephone, and your choice of background music. Additionally, the Coral has plenty of room to relax with three sundecks (some shaded), a jacuzzi, comfortable dining room, and lounge. Our very own naturalist guide, captain, and full board service staff will pamper us throughout!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e*Since we are chartering this amazing boat just for our travel club, the rooms range from standard, standard plus, \u0026amp; jr. suite.

We’ll alsoencounter \u0026amp; photograph marine iguanas, lava lizards, and blue-footed boobies along the way. Next, we’ll make our way down to the beach for snorkeling and a chance to see the famous Galapagos Penguins, sea turtles, and White-tipped Reef Sharks among a great variety of colorful fish.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e* Rabida Island: Dark-red sand covers the unique beaches of Rabida, home to thriving sea lions colonies. This island is considered the epicenter of the Galapagos due to thediversity of its volcanic geology. Nine species of the famous Darwin’s finches can also be found here. We’ll take a dinghy ride along marine cliffs to observe nesting seabirds \u0026amp; then jump into the water for a snorkel off the coast where marine life is particularly active.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e* Santiago Island; “Buccaneers Cove” \u0026amp; Espumilla Beach: This is an amazing location due to the remains of an eroded shoreline, home to seabirds, fur seals, and playful Galapagos Sea Lions. Photograph these beautiful creatures along with the cove’s unique shapes created by wave and wind erosion. The white, sandy Espumilla Beach nearby is in James Bay where mangroves and a small palo santo forest lead to salty-water lagoons home to wading birds like pink flamingos. We’ll visit and photograph a nesting site for sea turtles in the upper dunes of this area before another great snorkel to search for rays!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e* Black Turtle Cove: Back on the north shore of Santa Cruz Island and accessible only by sea, four species of mangrove crowd and form an internal lagoon \u0026amp; turtle sanctuary where sea turtles visit the calm waters.

Okie, here's a juicy detail about what this weekly event is about.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSpecial thanks to Charith (leader of chamber group) \u0026amp; Brian (asst. organizer), who first introduced me to the event like this @ Socha Cafe past year \u0026amp; also inspired me in many ways… I am sure a number of you already heard about this before by now. Revolution Cafe is located in the Mission SF. This venue is hosting a live classical music jam by the Classical Revolution led by Charith Premawardhana every Monday evening from 8 until close to 11. Of course you are not obligated to stay until the end. Please try the link Classical Revolution, and find out who they are. I feel that my words aren’t adequate enough to describe this talented passionate classical musician group. Bottom line: I luuu…vit period!:) It’s free and donation’s suggested. The venue also offers great selection of food, goodies, and drinks, and they are decently priced too. Come around 8 to be seated within good proximity to the music. Unfortunately(?)There's no public program posting for this event ahead of time. You just come \u0026amp; find out what's on the menu for the evening! Generally I like the idea of being surprised… believe it or not it has been so haha!:)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWell, I’ve been enjoying a lot since the ambience intertwined with live classical music there is really something very unique and friendly to all listeners regardless. Plus it helps me decompress from work/study stress. Forget not to mention schmoozing with like-minded folks with live classical music playing in the background is definitely worth craving. Hope it will do more or less the same benefit to you if you are like me.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo, please feel free to join other classical music fellas for this weekly schmooze time @ Revolution Cafe.

Water is available from a nearby faucet and carried to the CF in plastic gallon containers supplied by LHS volunteers. There are garbage cans on the CF but you need to bring your own waste bags.

However, we recommend you park in the school parking lot (allowed on weekends) located at the corner of Wabash Ave \u0026amp; Garden Dr. Driving in on Wabash, take a right turn into the school grounds at the corner with Garden Dr. Then follow the walking path outlined in blue on the attached map to walk from the parking lot to the CF; the door to enter the CF will be on your left side by a baseball batting cage opposite tennis courts. There is no signage so look for a regular tall metal door to enter.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5c1950c0245bce336c3e031d"},"name":"Weekly Wednesday Lunch Meetup in San Mateo","description":"\u003cp\u003eWe've moved back to grassy Joinville Dog Park for the non-rainy season! Join us anytime on Wednesdays for our weekly meetup. We're a friendly group of 5-10 regulars and totally welcome newcomers if you happen to have free time.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis dog park is a small neighborhood place inside the greater Joinville Park, so no separate small dog section or double-gate entry, but there is water, poop bags \u0026amp; trash cans, and bench seating. Shade is limited but we put up a shade tent over the benches on hot days. We usually have the dog park almost to ourselves, and it's right by the lagoon with a nice relaxed atmosphere.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDirections:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe dog park is located within a regular park that has a children's area, baseball field, pool, etc., so it's necessary to walk deep into the park on the main path to get to the dog park.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFrom Kehoe Ave., turn left into the unmarked lane after the school's black fence and before the swim center (if you get to the stop sign at Roberta, you've gone too far). Drive as far in as possible to park right before the roundabout. Take the main path from the roundabout to the left of the baseball field, turn left at the fork to cross the bridge by the sewage plant, and then you'll see the dog park straight ahead (marked by a blue dot on the map in the comments).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf you're coming from SF/North, it's possible to access the park off 3rd Ave. East (J. Hart Clinton Dr.). Pass Seal Point Park on your left and turn right on Detroit Dr. This is an industrial/commercial neighborhood, but it's sometimes possible to find 1-2 open parking spots on the street by the dog park's northern entrance. You could also drive passed Detroit and make a right on the first street after the bridge over the lagoon, Anchor Rd. This is a residential area with street parking available so you can enter on the dog park's eastern end.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNOTE: For safety reasons--no treats, toys, food, dogs in heat, or small children at the meetup.

The goal of this festival is to connect like-minded individuals who are action-oriented, wish to support a shared vision of gender equality, have a desire to experience their passions and environments through a uniquely female lens, and above all, love adventure.

They disappeared into the night, wearing only the meager life preservers they made from stolen rain coats, and were never found, seen, or heard from again.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e39 years later, on June 11, 2001, Pedro Ordenes and Gary Emich became the first swimmers to successfully “Escape from Alcatraz” 100 times!

Dr. Milton Erickson, M.D. is, perhaps, the most famous name in the use of therapeutic hypnosis in 20th Century. His ability to help people change problems into solutions was legendary. One of the techniques he used was telling stories and metaphors to his clients.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eGreg will explain a few simple techniques that you can use straight away to craft and deliver metaphors to your clients to help them resolve problems.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eErickson was able to deliver metaphors to a small group of training hypnotherapists and all of them would end up getting something out of it, some healing and change.

You can wonder if Greg might do this for this meetup group - guide you into trance and tell a metaphor that will have deep and profound meaning for you and whatever personal issues you may be working on.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou will learn a profound, almost secret technique, that you can use to assure that your hypnotic trances and metaphors for your clients will be deep and life changing, almost all the time.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs always, in these meetups, plenty of time will be given to pairing up and practicing these techniques with each other.

Dr. Diaz has reached out to us again, this time in search of 8 divers to pilot his astronaut training program. One major difference for this event, however, is that pre-registration is required. Participants will need to provide their e-mail address and take a 20 minute online assessment prior to participation in the diving portion.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eVolunteer divers will help him collect the final data set that he needs to refine, insure, and market the opportunity to future space travelers. Each volunteer, however, will get credit for having completed the first two segments of the commercial astronaut training program for their participation.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis segment of the training is a four part team assessment that includes a series of activities and tasks teams will be asked to complete while wearing full scuba gear (minus fins) in a submerged Space Vehicle Mockup (SVM). The two segments of the assessment divers will participate in are intended to mimic what one would experience in a planetary low gravity environment (i.e. on the moon or Mars) and in a zero gravity environment (i.e. in a space station).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eVolunteers are asked to show up with full SCUBA gear including tanks and weights. Full face masks with communication units will be fitted to their equipment prior to participation. Participation will include a brief full face mask introduction in shallow water along with a neutral buoyancy check. Divers will then proceed to the near shore submerged SVM and proceed as teams of 2-4 with the assessment (after having removed and secured their fins). I as well as several others will be serving as in-water safety support should there be some nervousness about not having fins while in the water. Dr. Diaz will be observing and recording the interactions of the team members as they complete a series of activities per the assessment.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis is truly an exciting opportunity for divers in the area to have a unique experience while diving and get in at an early level on the prospect of traveling to space. Since I've been initially contacted, I've been amazed at how fast commercial space travel is approaching us. The first 12 commercial space travelers were featured on the national news in August of this year to launch with SpaceX and Boeing. Elon Musk's SpaceX, Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin, Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic, and Robert Bigelow's Bigelow Aerospace are all preparing for launching commercial space travelers into space as early as 2019!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eParticulars:\u003cbr/\u003e1. Divers must be certified divers and be able to provide proof of certification upon arrival as a prerequisite to participation.\u003cbr/\u003e2. Participation is limited to adult divers only (18+)\u003cbr/\u003e3. Participation will be limited to no more than 8 volunteers\u003cbr/\u003e4. In order to receive credit, an online assessment is required. The assessment must be completed before the event and participants must receive an email confirming the dive team they will be assigned to join.\u003cbr/\u003e5. Participants will need to provide all of their own gear. They should be prepared to dive with all gear. One tank will be sufficient to complete both segments. During the activity they will be fitted with a full face mask and com unit and asked to remove their fins. But still come with mask and fins.\u003cbr/\u003e6. Divers should be prepared to dive in cold water at altitude. Lake Tahoe is approximately 55F currently and at an altitude of 6300 ft above sea level. An altitude diver certification is not required, but is highly recommended. Divers are expected to know the altitude function on their computers.\u003cbr/\u003e7. Volunteers, being certified divers, will assume responsibility for their own dive profiles, altitude compensation, and bottom times.\u003cbr/\u003e8.

Instead, it uses special meditation techniques with Divine Names in order to induce an elevated state of consciousness (mystical ecstasy) that provides direct contact with the Divine Mind (Active Intellect/Nous). The goal of this practice is to receive a prophetic revelation in the form of a voice, vision, or special mystical insight.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe main exponent of Prophetic Kabbalah was the thirteenth century Kabbalist, Abraham Abulafia, who revealed the details of Secret Divine Names and their special meditation techniques in his writings.

In recent years, Abulafia’s writings have been made more generally available, and some have now been translated into English.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis presentation is an introduction to Prophetic/Ecstatic Kabbalah, its specialized meditation techniques, and the types of mystical experiences to be obtained.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFeatured Speaker:\u003cbr/\u003eLloyd Abrams has presented many programs and workshops on Kabbalah.

Forest bathing is meant to be accessible to everyone — it's not about going on a long hike, but rather about slowing down and connecting deeper to the world around you.

A longer trip also means that you’ll have more opportunities to see the Northern Lights! Iceland is not a cheap destination and this tour is 10 days.

I appreciate it is somewhat off-putting to have only one or two RSVPs, as it appears to make the group smaller than it actually is.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRain days are at the Chinese Pavilion (the gazebo on the Stowe Lake island just past the waterfall). It is a bit less muni friendly, but car parking should be available on the lake for those who travel that way.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn it's favor, the location has nearby bathrooms, it feels more martial artsy, it can handle eight, is covered, so no rained out. But more importantly, great acoustics. It's bothered me practicing Sonny's stuff without music, this place solves that.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI am going to start allowing folks to spar/play - a major gear-shift from the self-defense/combatives scenario approach I have used since I started organizing this group. It is strictly optional. I am going to require three classes before I let you play.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe distinction I am making here is spar = without weapons, play = with trainer-weapons - rattan is basically banned.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs always, no fight club, no dog brothers.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e(Several of you have taken exception to my no dog brothers rule, implying, \"we're not all idiots.\" After all, a guy trained by subject of a dog brother documentary, Sonny Umpad, and fracking punk-rock anarchist icon, Frank Discussion, should delight in training you to take out guys wearing riot gear. Sadly, this is not the case.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe problem isn't the TFM or the dog-brothers, per say, the problem is its devotees tend to develop an attitude that becomes a problem. The dog brother attitude/approach makes it difficult for some rare individuals within their ranks and on their periphery to know why they are training. Of the three people I've kicked to the curb/banned from this group, two fell into that category. The third was a mentally disturbed registered sex offender.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHighly recommend watching the original Japanese \"Shall we dance,\" movie if you are still a bit confused about what I will and will not accept behavioral-wise.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePeople of all levels and different Martial Arts systems are welcome to attend.

Each day’s inspiration is drawn from the products themselves and is an articulation of their natural flavors, served at their peak taste. Our cooking is slow and deliberate, pausing to pay attention to all the little details that make good food great. We work with a small group of fishermen, hunters, gatherers, ranchers, and farmers to find and follow microclimates that produce the highest quality products in local existence. All of the cooking revolves around open wood fire and a fireplace designed for Chef Skenes's unique methodology, techniques, and tools for extracting the best tastes in our products.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Nommery\"\u003eLike Nommery on Facebook\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/nommery\"\u003eFollow us on Twitter\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://nom.ms/sTAngOgjHQ\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eClick HERE\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/a\u003e to reserve your seat on Nommery!

We STRONGLY recommend that you put your deposit down ASAP. This way we can reserve your place. For every trip we do there are people who come in too late because they kept thinking about it too much. Life does not wait for you if you hesitate. You know this trip was in your bucket list, so jump in right now!!!! :-)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFLIGHTS\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFlights are NOT included. Flights are very easy to book nowadays on your own and some people want to do side trips, so it gets really unpractical to include flight. Besides many of you can use miles or other ways of making your flight free or saving money if you book it by yourself. So instead of including air, we will give you guidelines so you can go to Kayak.com, Cheapoaire.com, Expedia.com, Orbitz.com, or any booking website and book your own. The best time to book a flight is usually 2-3 months before (the best day is Tuesday and the best time is between 12:00 and 3:00 PM). We will book ours at that point and e mail the group telling you what we got. If you do book the flight, we’ll meet at LAX. If not, we’ll just meet you there.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI did a quick search and already found flights as low as[masked] round trip!

The itinerary and package we put together has you taking the classroom or online course and doing your pool modules beforehand, so you don’t have to waste your time during our vacation doing those things. You can contact any PADI dive shop and arrange those, and I can help you with that. If you prefer to do it all in the Philippines, that is possible too, but I strongly recommend against it because you want to spend your time in your vacation diving; not sitting in a classroom or diving in a pool. You can email me if you have any questions and we can discuss this.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e- All the optional activities will be arranged and paid for at El Galleon.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e- Because of the adventurous nature of our trips, our itinerary and some locations are subject to change due of weather, tides, road conditions, logistics and other unforeseen circumstances. It’s not likely, but it could happen. Whenever we make a change in the itinerary, we will do our best to keep the integrity of the trip.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e- Passport is required, of course, as in all international travel.

Because there is so much to do besides diving, this will be a great trip to bring our non-diving friends, family, boyfriend, girlfriend, etc. There are beautiful beaches to lay out and snorkel, as well as tons of other activities including hikes to water falls, 4x4 adventures, ziplining and even an adventure park.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs always, we are taking advantage of the weekend and arriving on Saturday before Thanksgiving to make this a 9-day vacation, but only have to take 3 days off work. Actually we’ll have to take the Friday off too, since the flight crosses the timeline, so 4 days off work for a 9-day vacation; still awesome. Now, because we cross the timeline, we can leave late on Sunday and enjoy one extra full day in the Philippines and arrive back in the U.S. Sunday earlier, so we truly have full days. I love traveling back from Asia because on the way back you arrive before you left! :-D :-D\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe are staying at El Galleon dive resort, one of the best dive resorts in Puerto Galera, and we got a package of unlimited guided boat dives for 7 days.

All the activities besides diving will be optional and carry an extra cost, although things in the Philippines are so cheap, those costs will be very small.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHere is our planned itinerary:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSATURDAY, NOVEMBER 17:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eArrive at any time.

S. Supreme Court threw out North Carolina’s congressional district maps because the State legislature had packed two districts with an overwhelming majority of Afro-Americans to dilute minority influence in other districts. The gimmick contributed to guarantee control of one party over most districts. The Court ruled that: \"A state may not use race as the predominant factor in drawing district lines, unless it has a compelling reason.\"\u003cbr/\u003eNow the Court must address the issue of political gerrymandering, the manipulation of boundaries with the purpose of guaranteeing control not based on race but on partisanship.\u003cbr/\u003eJudges do not live in a vacuum. Prevailing social convictions and tendencies do influence their decisions. Having ruled against racial gerrymandering as near as the first week of July, there is a real opportunity that the despicable practice of gerrymandering be dealt with once and for all.\u003cbr/\u003eAt the same time, we must campaign for legislation against gerrymandering.

Shari's has offered the space to us at no charge, and they just ask that we do make purchases so even though the purchase of dinner is not mandatory, it will be helpful so that we don't have to pay for the room. So bring your appetite and questions you may have about River Cruises. We will also have some door prizes and booking incentives for those that choose to join us on a Cruise next year. We will also be inviting 2 other Travel Meetup groups to join us. Hope to see you there.\u003c/p\u003e ","link":"https://www.meetup.com/WorldTravelers-Adventurers-BucketListers-in-the-Bay/events/255402504/","created":{"$numberLong":"1539119530000"},"status":"upcoming","start_time":{"$numberLong":"1540346400000"},"end_time":{"$numberLong":"1540351800000"},"duration":5400000,"venue":{"id":3062601,"name":"Shari's Restaurant","location":[-122.43680572509766,37.630714416503906],"address_1":"2010 Rollingwood Drive","city":"San Bruno","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"94066","state":"CA"},"price":0,"is_free":true,"category":{"id":23,"name":"Outdoors \u0026 Adventure"},"meta_category":{"id":242,"name":"Outdoors \u0026 Adventure"}}

Right before we were set to start, Veritas contacted Supervisor Peskin's office and said that if he did not attend the event, then Veritas would sit down and negotiate all pending O\u0026amp;M passthroughs across the city. I spoke with Sup. Peskin's office about this decision, and Sup. Peskin decided to not attend to keep that option on the table while ensuring the press conference would still continue.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThat was a VICTORY for us, as it gave us new leverage to negotiate pending passthroughs for buildings that won't benefit from the legislation!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThen, the Veritas lobbyist called Supervisor Fewer and begged us to call off the march to Greentree's office. Because of organizing this action, we suddenly gained leverage. I brought the issue to the tenants who were there, and tenants voted to continue with the press conference and march.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs a result of this action, we got leverage to negotiate other buildings' pending passthroughs AND we saw what weakens Veritas: organized tenants, public action, and media exposure!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor the legislation, it was introduced that day, April 3. We are now in a 30-day waiting period before it goes to committee for a public hearing. During this time, we need to talk with our supervisors.

You can cut corners to make it more affordable by staying in land-based hotels and then do day trips out to some of the islands, but you would not get to see the more far flung islands this way. We have opted for a cruise because a land-based tour in the Galapagos puts you with many other tourists which can make each boat transit time as long as 2 hours one way (or more) on dinghy.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe chose a cruise rather than a land-based experience, so that we can go to the more far flung islands that land based tourists will not get to see. We'll sail at night and then wake up at our next destination. The cruise is 5 days/4 nights. Most cruises are either a 4, 5 or 8 days. The 4 day cruise is a bit too short and the 8 day a bit too long. The 5 day cruise allows for just the right amount of time to explore the Galapagos. If you would like to look at the boat we'll be sailing around the islands, please click on the link below. The maximum amount of travelers on the boat we take is 16 people and there are 9 rooms available. This is a first-class, luxury boat and is one of the top 3 boats that sails in the Galapagos!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOur boat in the Galapagos : \u003ca href=\"http://www.alya-cruise.com/\" class=\"linkified\"\u003ehttp://www.alya-cruise.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe reason a smaller boat is better is because of the ease in which to do day excursions. Many tour groups opt for larger boats and in doing so you will have 50 - 100 other people that will be with you on the beaches and hikes making for a not so serene hike or tons of people in your pictures on \"deserted\" beaches.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAlso, you must load into a dinghy to get from the cruise boat to the islands and with over 50 people, the load time can take over an hour. So when you are on a small boat with a maximum of 16 travelers, it allows for a genuinely private tour.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYour round-trip flight Quito - Galapagos is included in the cost of the trip, which is approximately $600. Most tours start in the Galapagos, so that means no taxi transfers, internal flights or hotel rooms are included. These can all come to a total of $1,000 or more.

Spokenvote is written in the AngularJS Javascript framework, so it's an excellent opportunity to take your Javascript skills into the front lines of the Javascript revolution.

We think the process should be intuitive, fun, and democratic.

It starts with spontaneously capturing ideas as they occur to us. When we do that as a diverse group, a “power of the crowd” effect is introduced. The result is often a revelation of common sense that is difficult to discover from a top-down approach.

Using deceptively simple language, the question is whether there are more than mere things. Take all the fundamental individual things, including their fundamental properties and relations. Is anything left unspecified? Are two possible worlds, identical in all their individual specifics, themselves identical? The thesis called Humean Supervenience answers, yes, as does Rodrigo and the author of this week's paper \"Humean Supervenience\" by David Lewis. Kenny, cautiously reluctant to assent to any metaphysical claims that seem to hazard a priori reasoning, is concerned that this claim leaves important questions about chance, universals, laws, norms, and other metaphysical notions out in the cold.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe are all beginners this week.

Heal them from their root causes?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere is ancient wisdom that is surfacing in 21st century America, wisdom that is showing us more skillful ways to be a human being. This deep traditional awareness is telling us that we are, at our core, energy bodies. It is also telling us we when regulate and harmonize the flow of our internal energy our life can start to come into balance.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAt the center of this system are seven major wheels of spinning energy called chakras. They stretch along your spine from the tailbone to the crown of your head. Between them, they represent the full range of human experience; from the tooth and claw struggle of survival to the ultimate bliss of uniting with the universe. For most of us, we fall somewhere in between and are a hodgepodge mixture of slightly imbalanced chakras. But instead working to harmonize this foundational system we put most of our efforts on the struggle to control the outside experiences of our lives.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHowever, in this seven-week course we will work to start to harmonize our lives from the inside out. Each week will focus on the issues of one of the chakras. We will build a basic understanding of the dynamics of that chakra and then open-up time for everyone to express their relevant personal experiences. We will then we break into smaller groups and do interpersonal exercises which will give you more insight into your issues around that chakra. Finally, we will use hands-on meditative and other energy techniques so that you can learn control and best balance that chakra.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe are asking, that instead of joining these seven groups in a hunt and peck manner; that you sign up for the seven classes as one unit so that you can build a more stable energy structure for yourself and also that we will have a cohesive and supportive group to help everyone in this intimate journey.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe hope you can join us in this exploration into the fascinating and powerful dimensions that lie within us all.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAll the best,\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCindy and Paul\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePlace: Sima Space, 1918 Bonita Ave, Berkeley\u003cbr/\u003eIf you need the security code to get in the front door, call one of the numbers below.

Right before we were set to start, Veritas contacted Supervisor Peskin's office and said that if he did not attend the event, then Veritas would sit down and negotiate all pending O\u0026amp;M passthroughs across the city. I spoke with Sup. Peskin's office about this decision, and Sup. Peskin decided to not attend to keep that option on the table while ensuring the press conference would still continue.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThat was a VICTORY for us, as it gave us new leverage to negotiate pending passthroughs for buildings that won't benefit from the legislation!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThen, the Veritas lobbyist called Supervisor Fewer and begged us to call off the march to Greentree's office. Because of organizing this action, we suddenly gained leverage. I brought the issue to the tenants who were there, and tenants voted to continue with the press conference and march.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs a result of this action, we got leverage to negotiate other buildings' pending passthroughs AND we saw what weakens Veritas: organized tenants, public action, and media exposure!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor the legislation, it was introduced that day, April 3. We are now in a 30-day waiting period before it goes to committee for a public hearing. During this time, we need to talk with our supervisors.
